Lightweight markup languages are useful when writing texts, as they allow you to save a lot of time on creating HTML tags manually, speeding up any process related to writing. They are also particularly effective where the reader wants to read the source document as well as the output data.

Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nTheoretical information In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server may not save the full version of the modified files, but perform a so—called delta compression - save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored. Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the OS file system from changing the working copy of the file, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch. In addition, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classic ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\nGit Git is a distributed file version control system. The project was created by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Currently supported by Junio Hamano.\nThe system is designed as a set of programs specially designed for their use in scripts. This makes it convenient to create specialized version control systems based on Git or user interfaces. For example, Cogito is just such an example of a frontend to Git repositories, and StGit uses Git to manage a collection of patches.\nGit supports rapid separation and merging of versions, includes tools for visualization and navigation through the non-linear development history. The Git version control system is a set of command-line programs. They can be accessed from the terminal by entering the git command with various options. Due to the fact that Git is a distributed version control system, a backup copy of the local storage can be made by simple copying or archiving.\nBasic concepts Repository — the project in which the Git system was initialized. During initialization , a hidden folder is added to the project .git. The repository stores all working files and the history of their changes.\nThe root folder of the project is workspace. It contains all the files and folders necessary for its operation.\nStorage is the contents of a hidden folder.git. All workspace versions and service information are stored in this folder. The system automatically gives these versions a name consisting of letters and numbers. In the example above, these are be0f8e and d516600. It is not necessary to manipulate the folder .git manually. All work with the system is done by commands through special applications or the console.\nCommit is a special command that saves a new version of the project and adds it to the repository. The saved file displays: all the changes that occurred in the workspace, the author of the changes and a short comment describing the essence of the changes. Each commit stores the complete state of the workspace, its folders and project files.\nBasic git commands The most commonly used git commands:\n– creation of the main repository tree:\ngit init – getting updates (changes) of the current tree from the central repository:\ngit pull – sending all the changes made to the local tree to the central repository:\ngit push – view the list of modified files in the current directory:\ngit status – view current changes:\ngit diff – save current changes: – add …","date":1665100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665100800,"objectID":"07e02bccc368a192a0c76c44918396c3","permalink":"https://ZlataDyachenko.github.io/post/writing-technical-content/","publishdate":"2022-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-technical-content/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction to the git version control system.","tags":null,"title":"Version control.
