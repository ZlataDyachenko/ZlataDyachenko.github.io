      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;last-week&#34;&gt;Last week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I managed to complete several academic tasks, which I would like to tell you more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the discipline &amp;ldquo;Mathematical foundations of information security and information security&amp;rdquo;, I completed the third laboratory work, the topic of which was encryption by gamming. Implemented encryption using a finite- length gamma üëèüèº&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also completed the third laboratory work in the discipline &amp;ldquo;Scientific Programming&amp;rdquo;, which was aimed at gaining skills in working with Octave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed laboratory work on the discipline &amp;ldquo;Modeling of wireless networks&amp;rdquo;, thanks to which she learned how to apply distributions to transform random variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She wrote a test paper on the discipline &amp;ldquo;Additional chapters of queuing theory&amp;rdquo;, in which a mathematical model of a network with unicast connections was considered. To be honest, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t difficult. But in a week there will be another test in this discipline. Wish me luck!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to keep you informed of my academic achievements. Au revoir! üëã&lt;/p&gt;
